Network module
==============

Provides network interface information gathered by `networksetup -getinfo` and `system_profiler`


Remarks
---

* 'Wi-Fi ID' is stored as Ethernet
* ipv4conf is undetermined when the ipv4 configuration is 'Off' in the user interface.
* Getting AirPort information can take longer than the default allowed timeout. This can be disabled by setting `airport_scanned` to 1 in the networkinfo.py client script. After changing it, a new client package is needed

Configuration
-------------

### VLANS

Plot VLANS by providing an array with labels and a partial IP address of the routers. Specify multiple partials in array
if you want to group them together.
The router IP address part is queried with SQL LIKE

### Configuration file:

The configuration has to be a YAML file and is loaded from: 

`local/module_configs/ipv4routers.yml`

You can override this file by specifying the following variable:

`NETWORK_ROUTER_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/custom/config.yml`

Example:
```
Wired: 211.88.10.1
WiFi:
    - 211.88.12.1
    - 211.88.13.1
'Private range':
    - 10.%
    - 192.168.%
    - 172.16.%
    - 172.17.%
    - 172.18.%
    - 172.19.%
    - 172.2_.%
    - 172.30.%
    - 172.31.%
Link-local:
    - 169.254.%
```

### IP Address Server

Some organisations may not be keen on MunkiReport using [ipify](https://ipify.org), as it is also commonly used by malware. You can specify a custom server for getting a clients public IP using Munkireport's global preferences with the `IpAddressServer` key:
```bash
defaults write /Library/Preferences/MunkiReport.plist IpAddressServer 'https://myserver.example/'
```

This custom server should return only an IP address in response to a curl request. You can see an example of what this module expects with the following command:
```bash
curl -s https://api.ipify.org
```

To skip the external IP address, set the `IpAddressServer` key to `127.0.0.1` the below command or set it with a profile.
```bash
defaults write /Library/Preferences/MunkiReport.plist IpAddressServer '127.0.0.1'
```
